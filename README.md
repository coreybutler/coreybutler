### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I build code, communities, and companies. I manage Ecor Ventures LLC, a small portfolio of tech product and service companies. I primarily work with [@gbdrummer](https://github.com/gbdrummer) building the infrastructure for these awesome ventures:

- [Author.io](https://github.com/author) (software firm, built [Fenix Web Server](https://preview.fenixwebserver.com))
- [Metadoc.io](https://metadoc.io) (Tech Documentation Platform)
- [Butler Logic](https://butlerlogic.com) (R&D/Professional Services)

I cofounded/co-organize [Bleeding Edge Web](https://edgeatx.org), speak at conferences, answer tech questions on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Corey-Butler), and spend WAY too much time on Github. Aside from here, you can find my other OSS projects [@metadoc](https://github.com/metadoc), [@author](https://github.com/author), [@butlerlogic](https://github.com/butlerlogic), and [@ngnjs](https://github.com/ngnjs).
